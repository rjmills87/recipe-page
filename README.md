### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS3

### What I learned

I started with this simple recipe project more to see how Frontend Mentor worked. I was already very proficient in using base web technologies when I took on this project. However it always good to go back an sharpen up the skills every once in a while as I find that I will always solidify a concept or learn something new on every new project no matter the size.

### Continued development

I am going to continue to work through more Frontend Mentor challenges as I often struggle to come up with project ideas and they provide plenty of variety. I intend to work my up to more complex projects alongside learning new frameworks and technologies

### Useful resources

- [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - This helped me refresh my memory using certain HTML and CSS properties such as creating tables and registering font files within my style sheet . I really like this site and am always using it for reference.
